## Overview

This source code provides a template to implement cloth simulation. Please refer to the [course website](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/15464-s20/www/assts.html) for project instructions.

## Controls

The application reads data from a directory tree, expecting one asf file and
possibly several amc files per directory. Once the motion has been loaded,

* PAGEUP/PAGEDOWN selects motion for playback. On the Mac, hold down the fn key and type the up/down arrow keys.

* SPACE to toggle 0x (pause), 0.1x (slow), 1x (normal) speed

* TAB to toggle camera tracking, 

* ESC to quit

* mouse buttons for camera control. One the Mac, the three mouse
buttons are obtained using the normal button, the normal button while
holding down the option key, and the normal button while holding down
the "Apple" key.

* 'r' will reset cloth simulation

## Compiling

### 1. Windows

The environment has been setup for windows under VS2017. Click ide/VS2017/amc_viewer.sln and run.

### 2. Ubuntu 18.04

Step 1. Install dependencies (sdl1.2.15-dev, libxml2-dev) and compiling tools (jam)
```
sudo apt-get install alien
mkdir tmp
cd tmp
wget https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.15-1.x86_64.rpm
sudo alien -i SDL-devel-1.2.15-1.x86_64.rpm
cd ..
rm -r tmp
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
sudo apt-get install jam
```

Step 2. Compile with jam
```
jam
```

Step 3. Test
```
cd Dist
./browser
```
